Locale schema
	* single and double words are just fine, anything longer should have a tag
	* tag name rules:
		* tags should be ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS with words separated with _'s
		* descriptions are typically used in tooltips and header in sections
		* short descriptions will end in _DESC
		* long descriptions will end in _LONG
	* don't include the object being described in the name (no _TOGGLE or _TT) since it
	  can be used several times to describe different objects (in theory)
	* group related elements together, either by their location in the GUI/config,
	  or by purpose (Weapon categories, etc)

There are two types of filters: one which will prevent the recipe from showing up at all, and one which will prevent a specific type of acquire information from showing up.\nWith the first type of filter, these match the proprieties of the recipe (ie: binding).  If you toggle ARL to not show BoP recipes, no recipes that are BoP will show up in the scan.  The second type of filter deals with acquire information.  If a recipe is available as a mob drop, or from a vendor and you toggle to not show vendor recipes, the recipe will still show up but vendor information will be hidden for it.  The reason is that there is still another way to acquire this recipe (mob drop) so it should still be included in the scan."

You can check these at http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/\n\n2a) Disable addons such as Skillet or ATSW.\n\n3) If your problem is not listed and you are using the latest version verify your addon settings.  Verify filters, profiles, etc.\n\n4) You have found a bug that no one has reported before.  Create a new ticket at http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ with a descriptive heading about the problem.  In the ticket make sure you include the error message that you received (just the error message, I don't need a listing of the addons you use), the recipe/profession you were working with, and any other info that you think may help.\n\nWhen posting a bug report, do NOT include all of the addons from swatter.  This just makes it difficult to read.  If you want a good error reporting mod, get BugSack.  Do not post errors/missing recipes in the comments, or send them to me via a PM.  Post them as a ticket which I can address and track easily."

Why aren't they listed?  Turn off your 'classes' filter.  By default (and due to popular request) ARL will only show recipes which your class can use and most glpyhs are not usable by your class.\n\n3) I don't want to see opposite faction recipes! Turn on the factions filter.  This will set it up to only display your factions obtainable recipes.  If something still shows up and it shouldn't, please submit a bug report."
