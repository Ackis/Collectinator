With the first type of filter, these match the proprieties of the recipe (ie: binding).  If you toggle ARL to not show BoP entries, no entries that are BoP will show up in the scan.  The second type of filter deals with acquire information.  If a recipe is available as a mob drop, or from a vendor and you toggle to not show vendor entries, the recipe will still show up but vendor information will be hidden for it.  The reason is that there is still another way to acquire this recipe (mob drop) so it should still be included in the scan.
Please note that the tooltips will always hide the opposite faction methods of acquiring a recipe.  This has been done to save space in the tooltip since they can get quite large.]]

1) Download the latest version, available from http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/files/
2) Make sure there is not a bug report filed for your issue already.  You can check these at http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/
3) Disable addons such as Skillet or ATSW.
4) Read the bug reporting documentation at http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/pages/feedback-and-bug-reporting/
5) If your problem is not listed and you are using the latest version verify your addon settings.  Verify filters, profiles, etc.
6) You have found a bug that no one has reported before.  Create a new ticket at http://www.wowace.com/projects/arl/tickets/ with a descriptive heading about the problem.  In the ticket make sure you include the error message that you received (just the error message, I don't need a listing of the addons you use), the recipe/profession you were working with, and any other info that you think may help.
When posting a bug report, do NOT include all of the addons from swatter.  This just makes it difficult to read.  If you want a good error reporting mod, get BugSack.  Do not post errors/missing entries in the comments, or send them to me via a PM.  Post them as a ticket which I can address and track easily.]]

3) I don't want to see opposite faction entries! Turn on the factions filter.  This will set it up to only display your factions obtainable entries.  If something still shows up and it shouldn't, please submit a bug report.]]
