--[[
Locale schema
	* single and double words are just fine, anything longer should have a tag
	* tag name rules:
		* tags should be ALL_CAPITAL_LETTERS with words separated with _'s
		* descriptions are typically used in tooltips and header in sections
		* short descriptions will end in _DESC
		* long descriptions will end in _LONG
	* don't include the object being described in the name (no _TOGGLE or _TT) since it
	  can be used several times to describe different objects (in theory)
	* group related elements together, either by their location in the GUI/config,
	  or by purpose (Weapon categories, etc)
