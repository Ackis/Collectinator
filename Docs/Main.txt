==Donations==
I have setup a donation site via [http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462 Pledgie].  Feel free to donate if you like this mod.  I have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped me.  I did not write this mod with the intent to make any money from it.  I wrote it to help me with some needs that I saw in-game, and well with requests and my goal to make it filled with information it's become a massive project.

If you don't wish to donate money feel free to consider one of the following methods which may be more suitable:
* Volunteer time at your local animal shelter such as the [http://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/ Society for Prevention of Cruelty for Animals (SPCA)] or drop a few bucks off for them.  If you do this, please let [mailto:ackis@shaw.ca me] know.
* Send 	[mailto:ackis@shaw.ca me] some UDE Points.  These points are obtained from the [http://www.wowtcg.com/ World of Warcraft TCG and Mini] game.
* Send some gold to me in-game or help out with some rarer achievements. :)
